<p class="red">Essentia has served in a large number of research activities conducted at<a href="http://mtg.upf.edu"> Music Technology Group</a> since 2006. It has been used for music classification, semantic autotagging, music similarity and recommendation, visualization and interaction with music, sound indexing, musical instruments detection, cover detection, beat detection, and acoustic analysis of stimuli for neuroimaging studies. A list of highlighted academic publications can be found <a href="http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/research_papers.html">here</a>. Essentia and Gaia have been used extensively in a number of research projects and industrial applications.</p>
